<p>In the example project, we only have <strong>one main entry point</strong>:&nbsp;<code>app.js</code>.</p><p>In bigger projects - with multiple HTML&nbsp;pages - you <strong>might have multiple scripts</strong> for the different pages (HTML files)&nbsp;you might be building. Hence you <strong>might need more than one entry point</strong> because you want to build more than one bundle (i.e. not every HTML&nbsp;page uses the same script).</p><p><strong>This can easily be configured with Webpack:</strong></p><p>Instead of </p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">entry:&nbsp;'./src/app.js'</pre><p>use</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">entry:&nbsp;{
    welcome:&nbsp;'./src/welcome-page/welcome.js',
    about:&nbsp;'./src/about-page/about.js',
    // etc.
}</pre><p>Now Webpack will <strong>look up all these entry points</strong> and create one bundle per entry point - you can then link to these bundles in your respective HTML files.</p><p><strong>A simple rule that makes sense for most projects is:</strong></p><p><em>One entry point per HTML file because you typically have one script per HTML&nbsp;file.</em></p><p>If you share a script across multiple HTML files or you have a file that does not need any script, you of course can deviate from that rule.</p><p>You can <strong>learn more about multiple entry points</strong> with these two resources:</p><ul><li><p>Code Splitting (i.e. generating more than one bundle):&nbsp;<a href="https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/</a></p></li><li><p>Entry Point Configuration:&nbsp;<a href="https://webpack.js.org/concepts/#entry" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://webpack.js.org/concepts/#entry</a></p></li></ul><p>And in general, check out the official Webpack docs to dive into it in detail:&nbsp;<a href="https://webpack.js.org/guides/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://webpack.js.org/guides/</a></p>
