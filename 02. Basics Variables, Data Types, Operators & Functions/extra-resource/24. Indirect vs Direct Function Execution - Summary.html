<p>It can be confusing to see that there seem to be two ways of executing a function:</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">function add()&nbsp;{
  something =&nbsp;someNum + someOtherNum;
}</pre><p><code>add()</code> vs <code>add</code></p><p>It's important to understand why we have these "two ways"!</p><p><strong>In general</strong>, you call a function that you defined by <strong>using its name</strong> (e.g. <code>add</code>) and <strong>adding parentheses</strong> (with any parameters the function might need - or empty parentheses if no parameters are required like in the above example).</p><p>=&gt;&nbsp;<code>add()</code></p><p>This is how you execute a function from your code. Whenever JavaScript encounters this statement, it goes ahead and runs the code in the function. Period!</p><p><strong>Sometimes however</strong>, you <strong>don't want to execute the function immediately</strong>. You rather want to "tell JavaScript" that it should execute a certain function <strong>at some point in the future</strong> (e.g. when some event occurs).</p><p>That's when you don't directly call the function but when you instead just provide JavaScript with the name of the function.</p><p>=&gt;&nbsp;<code>someButton.addEventListener('click', add);</code> </p><p>This snippet would tell JavaScript:&nbsp;<em>"Hey, when the button is clicked, go ahead and execute add."</em>.</p><p><code>someButton.addEventListener('click', add());</code> would be wrong. </p><p>Why?&nbsp;Because JavaScript would encounter that line when it parses/ executes your script and register the event listener AND&nbsp;immediately execute add - because you added parentheses =&gt;&nbsp;That means (see above):&nbsp;<em>"Please execute that function!"</em>.</p><p>Just writing add somewhere in your code would do nothing by the way:</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">let someVar =&nbsp;5;
add
alert('Do something else...');</pre><p>Why?</p><p>Because you just throw the name of the function in there but<strong> you don't give any other information to JavaScript</strong>. It basically doesn't know what to do with that name (<em>"Should I&nbsp;run that when a click occurs?&nbsp;After a certain amount of time?&nbsp;I don't know..."</em>) and hence JavaScript kind of ignores this statement.</p>
