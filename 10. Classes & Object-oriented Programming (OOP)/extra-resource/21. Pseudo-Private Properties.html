<p>The addition of private fields and properties is <strong>relatively new</strong> - in the past, such a feature was not part of JavaScript.</p><p>Hence you might find many scripts that use a concept which you could describe as <strong>"pseudo-private"&nbsp;properties</strong>.</p><p><strong>It would look like this:</strong></p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">class User {
    constructor() {
        this._role =&nbsp;'admin';
    }
}

//&nbsp;or directly in an object

const product =&nbsp;{
    _internalId:&nbsp;'abc1'
};</pre><p><strong>What's that?</strong></p><p>It's a quite common convention to prefix private properties with an underscore (<code>_</code>) to signal that they should not be accessed from outside of the object.</p><p><strong>Important:</strong>&nbsp;It's <strong>just a convention</strong> that should signal something!&nbsp;It does <strong>NOT technically prevent</strong> access. You <strong>CAN</strong> run this code without errors for example:</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">const product =&nbsp;{
    _internalId:&nbsp;'abc1'
};
console.log(product._internalId);&nbsp;// works!</pre><p>It's really just a hint that developers should respect. It's not as strict as the "real" private properties introduced recently (<code>#propertyName</code>).</p>
