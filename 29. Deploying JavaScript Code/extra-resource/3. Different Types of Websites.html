<p>You can build different kinds of websites/ web apps.</p><p>Specifically, there are three major types you can differentiate:</p><ul><li><p>Static Websites (just HTML + CSS +&nbsp;JS)</p></li><li><p>Single-Page-Applications (SPAs, HTML + CSS&nbsp;+ JS with only one HTML&nbsp;page being served, client-side JS is used to re-render the page dynamically)</p></li><li><p>Dynamic/&nbsp;Server-side rendered Web Applications:&nbsp;Websites where the HTML&nbsp;pages are created dynamically on the server (e.g. via templating engines like EJS).</p></li></ul><p>You find a more detailed comparison here:&nbsp;<a href="https://academind.com/learn/web-dev/dynamic-vs-static-vs-spa/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://academind.com/learn/web-dev/dynamic-vs-static-vs-spa/</a></p><p>When deploying such websites, it's important to understand that sites with NO&nbsp;server-side code (i.e. Static Websites and SPAs), required only a static host (e.g. AWS&nbsp;S3, Firebase Hosting).</p><p>Pages where HTML&nbsp;is generated dynamically on the server require a host that is capable of executing the server-side code&nbsp;(i.e. a server that supports NodeJS, PHP or whatever language is being used).</p>
