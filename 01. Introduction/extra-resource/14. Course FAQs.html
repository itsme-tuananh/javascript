<p>Here are some common questions about this course:</p><p><strong>How long will it take me to complete the course?</strong></p><p>This is impossible to answer, seriously. An online course is not a sprint - it's a marathon. You can certainly rush through the course by ramping up the video playback speed to 2x and maybe skipping some videos. You'll then only take half the total hours of that course to complete it (or shorter). But chances are you won't learn much if you do that.</p><p>Instead, you should go through the videos carefully - pause occasionally and code along on your own. Maybe even go back to lectures or whole modules you completed in the past to validate that you really understood the concepts taught there.</p><p>Code along and maybe even explore with your own projects (or deviate the projects shown by me in the course).</p><p>These are the things that turn you into a real developer and it will of course take some time to gain confidence with the JavaScript language.</p><p><strong>What are the course prerequisites?</strong></p><p>NO&nbsp;JavaScript knowledge is required, basic HTML + CSS&nbsp;knowledge + web dev knowledge is recommended.</p><p>You should have a basic understanding of how the web works and which parts are involved (servers, browser, ...).

This article + video can get you started:&nbsp;<a href="https://academind.com/learn/web-dev/how-the-web-works/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://academind.com/learn/web-dev/how-the-web-works/</a></p><p><strong>Does this course teach Node.js?</strong></p><p>I&nbsp;focus on the browser since we got some visual output there - which in my opinion makes learning more fun. But the language is the same, so what you learn here of course also applies to Node.js.</p><p>There are some differences, some APIs (= functionalities) which only work in the browser or only work in Node.js - but I&nbsp;will highlight those and I also have a complete module where I&nbsp;provide a basic introduction to Node.js and how JavaScript works there.</p><p><strong>Which version of JavaScript does this course teach?</strong></p><p>The latest version. You learn modern JavaScript in this course!</p><p><strong>Do I need a Mac to follow along?</strong></p><p>No, absolutely not - any operating system works. I&nbsp;record the course on a Mac, that does not mean that you have to use one as well. There will be no differences.</p><p><strong>Which browser should I&nbsp;use to follow along?</strong></p><p>I recommend using Google Chrome. JavaScript works in all browser but to ensure that everything works just as shown in the videos, you should use the same browser I use there =&gt;&nbsp;Chrome.</p><p>Later in the course, you'll find a whole module about JavaScript and which features are supported by different browsers. This then allows you to fine-tune your scripts to different browsers (spoiler:&nbsp;In many cases, no adjustments are required!).</p><p><strong>Is XYZ included in the course (e.g. "Is JavaScript security included in the course?")</strong></p><p>Please check the course curriculum - you find all the content there. If something isn't listed there at all, chances are it's not included but asking doesn't hurt. But please first look, then ask. :)</p><p>You can also search the course - see the below screenshot:</p><figure><img src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2019-10-29_15-09-55-e1b933bba744fedab0ced37320418447.png"></figure>
