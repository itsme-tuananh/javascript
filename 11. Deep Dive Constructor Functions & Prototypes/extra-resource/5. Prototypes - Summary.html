<p>Prototypes can be a confusing and tricky topic - that's why it's important to really understand them.</p><p>A&nbsp;prototype is an object (let's call it <code>"P"</code>) that is linked to another object (let's call it <code>"O"</code>) - it (the prototype object)&nbsp;kind of acts as a "<strong>fallback object</strong>" to which the other object (<code>"O"</code>)&nbsp;can reach out if you try to work with a property or method that's not defined on the object (<code>"O"</code>) itself.</p><p><strong>EVERY&nbsp;object in JavaScript by default has such a fallback object</strong> (i.e. a prototype object) - more on that in the next lectures.</p><p>It can be especially confusing when we look at how you configure the prototype objects for "to be created"&nbsp;objects based on constructor functions (that is done via the <code>.prototype</code> property of the constructor function object).</p><p>Consider this example:</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">function User()&nbsp;{
    ... //&nbsp;some logic, doesn't matter =&gt;&nbsp;configures which properties etc. user objects will have
}
User.prototype =&nbsp;{ age:&nbsp;30 }; //&nbsp;sets prototype object for "to be created" user objects, NOT&nbsp;for User function object</pre><p>The <code>User</code> function here also has a prototype object of course (i.e. a connected fallback object) - <strong>but that is NOT&nbsp;the object the </strong><code><strong>prototype</strong></code><strong> property points at</strong>. Instead, you access the connected fallback/ prototype object via the <strong>special </strong><code><strong>__proto__</strong></code><strong> property</strong> which EVERY&nbsp;object&nbsp;(remember, functions are objects) has.</p><p>The <code>prototype</code> property does something different:&nbsp;<strong>It sets the prototype object, which new objects created with this User constructor function will have.</strong></p><p>That means:</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">const userA =&nbsp;new User();
userA.__proto__ ===&nbsp;User.prototype;&nbsp;//&nbsp;true
userA.__proto__&nbsp;===&nbsp;User.__proto__&nbsp;// false</pre>
